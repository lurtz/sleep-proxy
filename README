Keeps the illusion, that a host is powered on and available while it is powered
off or in standby. A small device, e.g. an OpenWrt router, using this programm
can wake this host using WOL upon an incoming connection.

To compile you need cmake and pcap installed. Your compiler should understand
C++11.

To build install pcap with its development files and run:
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

At runtime the commands ping, ping6, ip, iptables and ip6tables should be
available.
